Retirement is just around the corner for some Pewlett-Hackard employees. Pewlett-HAckard is a technology company that provides software and hardware solutions rather its a small amount of consumers or major enterprises. Pewlett-Hackard has a mass amount of tenured staff that are on thier journey to retirement. Our objective is to determine how many individuals will be retiring? What are the titles of the employees that are retiring and who is eligible for the mentorship program. First we analyzed all employees who were born between January 1, 1952 to December 31, 1955. We have created a database system of tables from csv files to see who retiring and eligible for mentorship.
